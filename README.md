## Data cleaning/exploring 
### Creating copy of the dataset

```sql
CREATE TABLE world_layoffs
LIKE layoffs_1;

INSERT world_layoffs
SELECT * from layoffs_1;
```

### Checking duplicated records

```sql
SELECT 
  company, 
  location, 
  total_laid_off,
  industry, 
  `date`, 
  country,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY company, 
  location, 
  total_laid_off, 
  `date`, 
  country) as number_rows
FROM 
  world_layoffs;

SELECT * FROM (
SELECT company, industry,
  location, 
  total_laid_off, 
  percentage_laid_off,
  `date`,
  stage, 
  country,
  funds_raised
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY company, industry,
  location, 
  total_laid_off, 
  percentage_laid_off,
  `date`,
  stage, 
  country, funds_raised) as number_rows
  FROM world_layoffs) as duplicates
  WHERE number_rows >1;
```
### Checking if duplicates are removed
```sql
DELETE FROM worlds_layoffs
WHERE row_num >1;
```

### Checking data quality
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM worlds_layoffs;

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM worlds_layoffs
WHERE industry IS NULL or industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM worlds_layoffs
WHERE company LIKE 'Appsmith%';


SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM worlds_layoffs
ORDER BY country;

SELECT DISTINCT company
FROM worlds_layoffs
ORDER BY company;

UPDATE worlds_layoffs
SET company = TRIM(' ' from company);

SELECT *
FROM worlds_layoffs
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT DISTINCT(stage), company, country
from worlds_layoffs
WHERE stage = '';

UPDATE worlds_layoffs
SET stage = 'Unknown'
WHERE stage = '';
```
### Deleting null and empty records

```sql
DELETE from worlds_layoffs
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;
```
